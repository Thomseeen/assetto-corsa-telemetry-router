# Assetto Corsa Telemetry Router
Simple C# tool to send data from AC and ACC's shared memory to i.e. an Arduino via Serial COM port.

Uses mdjarv's nice shared memory library for Assetto Corsa https://github.com/mdjarv/assettocorsasharedmemory and Billiam's data format for sending to be compatible with devices set up for https://github.com/Billiam/pygauge.
